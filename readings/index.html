            <h1 class="filsonBlack">R1: A Handmade Web</h1>
        </div>

        <h2 class="filsonReg">What is the thesis of this article? </h2>
        <p class="filsonReg">The thesis of the article is that “Handmade” websites are not necessarily better than
            premade company ones,
            but are a unique and timeless reflection of their creator and the subject it was coded for. One point the
            article makes is that online archives reflect their content and “...continue to exist in the medium within
            which they were created” (Carpenter 2015). Expanding from that, just like libraries containing books from
            authors around the world, Handmade Websites are made as a library tailored towards the books they hold.
            Referring to the uniqueness aspect, Carpenter had created a small book that was translated into a website
            meant to tell a circular story. His intention of uniqueness was to use his website to evoke the circular
            part of his story and start on the first page of the reading when finished, just like a book but online.
            Adding on, these websites retain their unique and timelessness by being Handmade. Usually, websites from
            companies would constantly update and renew themselves to suit changing customer needs. An example would be
            when an old radio starts working. It would not broadcast old content or speakers but what is currently
            playing in the present. Handmade Websites are not made for the intention of customers and utilizing
            templates, but for what their creator wants in a more creative sense. This results in old sites filled with
            broken links, page errors, and missing images with their own intended charm. </p>

        <h2 class="filsonReg">Carpenter describes the handmade web as a form of resistance. In your own words, what is
            being resisted?
        </h2>
        <p class="filsonReg">The Handmade Web resists the version of the web that washes away amateur coders and
            replaces them with
            predatory corporations. These corporations seek to only utilize websites for promotion rather than form a
            community or promote the ability to create for themselves. Moreover, these corporate websites lack a sense
            of individuality. They are all clean and professionally formatted compared to if a new coder made a tailored
            website towards a topic they were interested in. In terms of community, it has been brought up that it was
            common for people who produced Handmade Webs to rewrite each other's code. It was brought up that many
            readers have re-written source code from Nick Montfort which allowed them to experience making
            computer-generated text for the first time. In contrast, companies like Apple created iPads and other mobile
            devices to access material to consume while also losing the ability to inspect their page sources. This
            shows how tech companies ironically produce technology to access the web but do not allow their consumers to
            create for themselves. </p>

        <h2 class="filsonReg">Reflecting on your own experiences, what are other examples of drawing attention to the
            "physicality" of the
            web?</h2>
        <p class="filsonReg">“Physicality” defined for me is not only when a website is more visually unique but when
            users put in
            physical work to create the image. One website that reminds me of this mentality is “OUR/PLACE.” Now closed,
            the website mainly attracted Twitch streamers and got their fans to create a pixel art banner representing
            their brand by owning one pixel from the canvas. It was essentially a battle of popularity and an engaging
            way for not only the streamer to connect with their community but for the community to show their support in
            a “physical” way. Other than the Twitch community, the website also harboured many fandoms ranging from
            anime, games, TV shows and much more. Although I did not participate in the act of placing a pixel to create
            a character from a fandom I adore, I noticed the uproar from friends and streamers posting livestreams of
            their fans creating their signature banners. </p>

        <h1 class="filsonBlack">R2: What Screens Want</h1>
        <h2 class="filsonReg">What is the thesis of this article?
        </h2>
        <p class="filsonReg">The whole thesis of the reading is how one can design natively for screens. Chimero first
            describes his
            two-year search for the answer and directs readers to his recent discovery of aspirin. After going to the
            pharmacy, Chimero noticed his purchased aspirins were smaller than what was remembered. It turns out that
            the drug can be condensed further and just needs “padding” for it to be picked up and consumed. Similarly,
            computers and technology have undergone the same treatment through the passage of time but the “padding”
            being picked up resides inside the computer rather than outside. He proposed that visual metaphors were
            effective in understanding how to operate a computer interface-wise. One example he gave was that people
            would not know where to put unwanted files but having an image of a trash bin gives a clear direction.
            Additionally, computers are tools with many options and it is up to the designer to communicate what can be
            done, whether it's knowing you delete files using a trash can or continuously mold screens to fix how the
            user can experience/understand it the best. </p>

        <h2 class="filsonReg">Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo?
        </h2>
        <p class="filsonReg">I stand with the ideology of skeuo. It was useful how Chimero used two photos of horses to
            visually represent
            the two where one is flat design and one is design references the three-dimensional world. I always find it
            refreshing to find something unexpected in design but still communicate its intended need. Icons and flat
            logos are great, but there are only so many flat silhouettes to create or recreate where they do not overlap
            or copy each other in some way. Take the trash bin example, I would prefer to see an image of a realistic
            trashbin than its flat image counterpart just for that sense of refreshing variety. Metaphorically, there
            are so many trash bins in the world that I am more interested in their different texture and designs which
            can not be replicated with just flat shapes. Furthermore, real-life imagery that reflects the different
            cultures and the material it comes with is more compelling rather than a flat icon. Adding on, there is also
            a sense of blandness to most corporate logos as many have chosen this minimalistic route. Sure, the
            information it holds is more compact like an aspirin but it is to the point where there are millions of
            drugs like it. I would rather gulp down a bigger pill that is compact and enthralling in my eyes.</p>

        <h2 class="filsonReg">What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another
            example from
            filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.</h2>
        <p class="filsonReg">Originating in 1872, the zoopraxiscope is a collection of high-speed photos radically spun
            on a glass disc.
            When spun, the photographs appear as light redirects and show the imagery as if there was a movement
            happening from the photos but on a screen. This relates to the term “flux” as embodies the capacity to
            change. A simple bet between horse riders evolved into a gateway for filmmaking and graphic design. The
            zoopraxiscope relates to the web as the web is also prone to constant change which can evolve into something
            great like UI components. Responsive components like toggle or progressive disclosure are great for users to
            avoid confusion and guide them to what they want out of the website. If someone purchases an item, the
            stateful toggle gently guides them into entering their information and hiding their list for the next step.
            This lets them know they completed what they wanted and they can move on instead of complicating their
            experience by managing and navigating through multiple buttons. I know that pixel art has inspired digital
            design icons and typeface-wise. As previously mentioned in a past lecture, Susan Kare created icons that
            were easy to use and made up of simple pixels. This notion eventually led to more stunning varieties of
            pixel art in the design and gaming communities along with typefaces made from pixels to suit computers.</p>
