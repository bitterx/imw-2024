        <h1 class="chantal">A Used Notebook</h1>

        <p class="felt">A website is like a notebook. It can store your best or worst works. There can be single
            or
            grided lines defining what to place but it can always be broken. You can flip the notebook however you
            please,
            it is made for your own
            needs. The only restriction is the ideas you do not put onto the malleable and glaring bright paper. It is
            transformative. Recorded recipes, an archive of written ideas, and a sketchbook of daily doodles, you can
            paste
            and type whatever comes to mind. The dry messy ink can be spelling errors or slang only you would
            understand.
            Crumpling a piece of paper would be a simple right and left click. Maybe after a few years, you will pick up
            the
            book from a dusty forgotten file and flip through it. Laughing and feeling nostalgic over all the small
            ideas
            you came up with. The written typeface enacts a different voice you once had but have moved past. The style
            of
            drawing you diligently kept consistent needed to be updated. In the end, these aspects are a part of your
            being
            and as the notebook is being put away, you can't help but be reminded of what your thinking was back then
            and
            are glad you came so far from it. </p>
