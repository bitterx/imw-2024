        <h2>Are.na and Research</h2>
        <p>
          After going on <a href="https://www.are.na/samantha-liu/interaction-project-inspo"> Are.na </a>, I found
          a website that archives websites that mainly use the hover element. Some
          aspects I noticed from the websites were that they gave little to no direction or context on how to explore
          them. This gave me idea to make users visiting my website to explore/hover with no context. Some elements I
          noticed were that when interacting with one element, others abstract elements would be affected too like from
          Sam's
          website. Another visual idea inspired by the archive was that I could take abstract imagery and make objects
          appear connected to them. I additionally researched
          how hover is utilized from contemporary websites and how useful it is. Aspects like improving user
          interaction, enlarging imagery, adding/fading colour, and bringing information came up from the exploration.

        <h2>Figma and Sketches</h2>
        <p>
          I initially came up with this idea to display my trip to Japan over the Summer using hover elements but
          decided to not use it. There were abstract elements but after getting critiqued, the idea focused using the
          hover function rather than the function itself. After commuting with my friend, she was playing a mystery
          puzzle game and it dawned on me how she used small clues to finish the level just by exploring and gather
          visual
          information. That little notion inspired me to create a website where hover pushes the user into moving on
          from visual feedback. Aspects like hovering over elements in order to move on to another "level" (change in
          colour,
          animation, or size) is what I wanted in my own code.

        <h2>Coding Production</h2>
        <p>
          I first reviewed some javascript exercises to refresh my understanding. Afterwards, I made another folder to
          test out and experiment with my code. If the iteration worked well, I would paste it in my main folder for
          submission. I would say it took a long time trying to format my squares since I initially used VW and VH for
          positioning so when I resized my screen smaller, the squares merged together. After asking some peers for help
          and going on W3schools, the problem was solved.

          <p> I also referenced how I would personally use hover and one
            aspect I wanted to include was how I read text on a website. This lead to the creation of my second page
            which contained words instead of shapes. The only way you would move on is if you hovered over the word
            "respond." I made it
            clear that the title would change font and colour to make a small clue that it might apply with the
            paragraph text as well. I also used the colour purple for both hover changes for another visual hint.</p>

          <p> After getting feedback, I decided to make my last level a little harder. It was too straightforward in
            that
            the user could just hover over circles and move on to the next. I decided to make more circle copies so
            that
            users would have to actively search/hover for the correct circle in order to move on. I copied and
            pasted the CSS, changed their positioning and added them to my Javascript to make this possible.</p>
