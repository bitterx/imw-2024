        <h2>Visual Inspo</h2>
        <p>
          After going on Pinterest and Behance, I found poster examples for events as a way to organize my information.
          I also referenced art for the event like the cupsleeve designs me and the other co-vendors made. I noticed the
          images used either serif or curvy sans-serif typefaces. I then got my sketchbook and combined compositions I
          liked from the designs.

        <h2>Rough Figma Iterations</h2>
        <p>
          I moved to Figma and started playing around with my sketch compositions using at least two typefaces.
          After recieving critique from peers and my professer, I moved to colouring the roughs. It was suggested I
          should take pictures from the movies for colours and so I tried limiting it to at least three combinations. It
          was also suggested
          that I could make different HTML pages that are coloured based on which ghibli movie the vendors liked. I also
          wanted to
          add star or flower accents beside the titles as a reference to either Totoro or Howl's Moving Castle.

        <h2>Coding Production</h2>
        <p>
          I used the inclass exercise as a template and curated it according to my Figma prototype. I also realized the
          typeface I used for my Figma iteration could not be used for public websites so I went on Adobe fonts and
          search for something similar. After my
          initial production, I started picking more colours and customizing each vendor's page and also asked what they
          would like for their description. For @gl.schwartz's page, she favoured Pom Poko so I added brown colours
          based off the animals from the film.
