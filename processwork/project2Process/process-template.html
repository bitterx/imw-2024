        <h2>Visual Inspo</h2>
        <p>
          After going on Pinterest and Behance, I found poster examples for events as a way to organize my information.
          I also referenced art for the event like the cupsleeve designs me and the other co-vendors made. I noticed the
          images used either serif or curvy sans-serif typefaces. I then got my sketchbook and combined compositions I
          liked from the designs.

        <h2>Rough Figma Iterations</h2>
        <p>
          I then moved to Figma and started playing around with my sketch compositions using at least two typefaces.
          After asking for advice from peers, I moved to colouring the roughs. It was suggested I should take pictures
          from the movie and so I tried limiting it to at least three combinations.

        <h2>Coding Production</h2>
        <p>
          After referencing my figma pages, I wanted to add more imagery and ended up searching online how to create
          more shapes like stars, lines, ect. From previous experience I also linked fonts to make my text look more
          visually pleasing.
