        <h2>Visual Research</h2>
        <p>
          After going on Pinterest near the start of the term, I complied imagery I wanted to experiment with
          artistically and source website ideas from.
          I came across many photos of food and it developed into the art of isometric buildings and rooms. Rooms were
          a way to express my personality in showing the objects I owned/wanted to own. I also wanted showcased my
          personality with how I experienced each catagory with my
          character's reactions. Using Procreate, I used the monoline pen and drew all of the illustrations.

        <h2>Figma and Sketches</h2>
        <p>
          I ended up trying ideas like "shopping with me" but ended up choosing to show myself in a small room. I
          recieved critique to make my layout more interactive tool so I made icons instead of a list with links for
          each
          category.
          I developed the idea of making hover the main interactive as a way to showcase my own artstyle. From a
          previous assignment, I got the code professer Shaheer. He gave me the Javascript code on how to show a before
          and after image
          so I decided
          to
          utilize what I
          learned from last term.

        <h2>Coding Production</h2>
        <p>
          I first tried utilizing grid and ended up making my index's spacing too far. I reached out to peers for advice
          and soon resolved it.
          The layout looked too empty so I wanted to add a typewriter animation to my titles to enact the feeling of
          entering a game. Some games I played like "Pocket Life"
          had a similar style and the animation would add on to the "game effect" of my index. In addition, I added a
          health,
          energy, and bubble tea bar to add onto the effect as well.
